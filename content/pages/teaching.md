## Philosophy

I believe in open-source-based teaching, with using community codes such as Jupyter notebooks. While a part of the courses include theoretical background, I favor hands-on learning through practicals and projects.

| My courses rely on [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) for interactive computing and data visualization with Python. Jupyter notebooks provide an ideal environment for combining code, visualizations, and explanatory text in a single document, making them perfect for teaching and learning. | We use [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) hosted on the [Dante supercomputing platform](https://www.ipgp.fr/en/research/research-platforms/dante/) at IPGP. This infrastructure, managed by the [S-CADAD facility](https://www.ipgp.fr/la-recherche/services-communs/s-capad/), allows students to access computational resources directly from their web browser without any local installation, ensuring a consistent learning environment for all participants. |

| We use [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the primary programming language for teaching. Python's simplicity and versatility make it an excellent choice for students of all levels, enabling them to focus on learning concepts. Additionally, Python boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that are widely used in scientific computing and data analysis. | The class supports are made with **Marp**, a tool for creating slide decks from Markdown files. This allows for seamless integration of content and visuals, making presentations more engaging and informative. |

### Scientific Computing for Geophysical Problems

This class aims at providing students with a sense of how one can use theory and computers together to test hypotheses regarding the working of a geophysical system. The testing involves the derivation of a theory with predictive power, that has to be checked against observations. Both theory and observations are impacted by uncertainty; one skill that students will acquire is the capability of assessing and propagating uncertainty in the analysis chain, through a series of computer labs specifically designed for the class. Check the online description on the IPGP website for a better overview. The course material is available on the GitHub repository and on demand.

### Earth Data Sciences

This class aim to develop the way geoscientific problems can be solved with computer, ranging from rule-based programs to deep learning. Based on theoretical lessons and Jupyter Labs, the audience will learn from both theory and examples that they can re-used afterwards.

### Programming for Geosciences

This class delivers the basics of programming in a language-agnostic way (Python, Octave, Matlab, or Julia). It aims at giving a sense on how to solve many different types of problem with a single tool: the computer. After 16 hours of theoretical courses, the class consists in a personal project developed during the class with the help of the teachers. The project can be selected from a list, or brought to the class.
