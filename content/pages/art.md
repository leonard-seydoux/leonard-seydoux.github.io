## Melodic Table of Elements

A side project to think about how art and science can meet. How to use iconic scientific representation to generate music in relationship with the scientific content? A first trial with the [melodic table of elements](https://leonard-seydoux.github.io/melodic-table-of-elements/).

The idea is to map each chemical element to a musical note, based on its atomic number. The higher the atomic number, the higher the pitch of the note. Additional properties of the elements, such as their group and period in the periodic table, can be used to determine other musical attributes like duration and volume.

Earth Rock is a project that translates seismic activity data into drum scores using Python and MIDI format. By processing a catalog of seismic events, the project converts the data into rhythmic patterns, creating an artistic representation of seismicity. This approach merges science and art, allowing the natural rhythms of the Earth to be expressed through music.

Another example of how data can be transformed into art, revealing patterns and rhythms that might otherwise go unnoticed. The project highlights the intersection of science, technology, and creativity, demonstrating how data can inspire new forms of artistic expression.
